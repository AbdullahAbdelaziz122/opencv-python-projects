# Text Detection and Extraction

This project demonstrates basic text detection and extraction from images using OpenCV and Python. The script `text-detection-extraction.py` processes input images to identify and extract text regions. It can be used for simple OCR tasks or as a starting point for more advanced text recognition projects.

## Requirements

- Python
- OpenCV (`opencv-python`)
- Tesseract OCR (install via your package manager, e.g., `sudo apt-get install tesseract-ocr`)
- pytesseract (`pip install pytesseract`)

## Usage

Run the script and provide an image file to detect and extract text regions.
